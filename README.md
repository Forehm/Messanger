# Messanger
A realization of the messanger.
this messanger will use an end-to-end encryption but it also uses a local network and ipv4 protocol.

There are two apps: server application and the client application;
It has only console interface now, but it is temporary

#Client application interface is just to debug the server app now. Client will have another realization and another structure!
