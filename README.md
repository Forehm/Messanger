# Messanger
A realization of the messanger.
this messanger uses an end-to-end encryption but it also uses a local network, protobuf, ipv4 protocol and TCP/IP. maybe it will also use some of the boost libraries

### Requirements: C++17, x86, protobuf(proto3)
There are two apps: server application and the client application;
It has only console interface now, but it is temporary

### Description:

Client application interface is just to debug the server app now. Client application will definitely have another realization and another structure with an interface and other features!
