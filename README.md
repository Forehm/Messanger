# Messanger
A realization of the messanger.
this messanger will use an end-to-end encryption but it also uses a local network and ipv4 protocol.

# Requirements: C++17 and x86
There are two apps: server application and the client application;
It has only console interface now, but it is temporary

#Client application interface is just to debug the server app now. Client application will definitely have another realization and another structure with an interface and other features!
