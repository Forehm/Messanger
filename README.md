# Messanger
A realization of the messanger. This messanger uses an end-to-end encryption but it also uses a local network, protobuf, ipv4 protocol and TCP/IP. maybe it will also use some of the boost libraries

### Requirements: C++17, x64, protobuf(proto3)
There are two apps: server application and the client application;
It has only console interface now, but it is temporary

### Description:
There are two applications: server and client. They are basically the same but they are a bit different;
The work of the messanger is set by sending different messages (commands) from the client application to the server one.


Client application interface is just to debug the server app now. Client application will definitely have another realization and another structure with an interface and other features!
