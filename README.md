# Messanger
A realization of the messanger.
this messanger will use an end-to-end encryption but it also uses a local network, ipv4 protocol and TCP/IP.

### Requirements: C++17 and x86
There are two apps: server application and the client application;
It has only console interface now, but it is temporary

Client application interface is just to debug the server app now. Client application will definitely have another realization and another structure with an interface and other features!
